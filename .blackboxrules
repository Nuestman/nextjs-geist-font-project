The user wants a comprehensive implementation plan for a driving school management system called UDrive System, aligned with Ghana's DVLA syllabus. The system should have a CMS core, database integration, separate interfaces for admins, instructors, and students, and features like student info management, scheduling, progress tracking, reports, payments, vehicle management, and admin oversight. The student learning experience should include a dashboard, learning pages with videos and quizzes, quiz functionality with progression gating, certificate generation, and RLS policies for data security. The system should have a public-facing homepage and related pages for customer conversion, and consider both web and mobile apps.

The user has provided images of the DVLA syllabus, which I have reviewed to understand the curriculum content and modules.

The current working directory has a Next.js project structure with many UI components under src/components/ui and some hooks and lib utilities. No existing files seem directly related to the driving school system yet.

I will now create a comprehensive implementation plan covering:

    System architecture and tech stack
    Core modules and features aligned with the DVLA syllabus
    User roles and interfaces
    CMS and content management approach
    Database design and security (RLS)
    Student learning experience details (dashboard, lessons, quizzes, certificates)
    Public-facing marketing pages
    Web and mobile app considerations
    Scalability and security considerations

This plan will be detailed and structured to guide the full development process.

No need to read files now as this is a new app plan request.

Proceeding to write the comprehensive implementation plan.

Here is the comprehensive implementation plan for the UDrive System driving school management app:
UDrive System - Comprehensive Implementation Plan
1. Overview

UDrive System is a scalable, secure, and user-friendly driving school management platform aligned with Ghana's DVLA learner driver syllabus. It will serve admins, instructors, and students with tailored interfaces and functionalities. The system will include a robust CMS for content management, integrated database for data storage, and a rich student learning experience with interactive lessons, quizzes, and certification.
2. Technology Stack
